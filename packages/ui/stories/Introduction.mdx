`@jakubmazanec/ui` is opinionated, pre-styled, but customizable component library based on
[React](https://react.dev/), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/),
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Conform](https://conform.guide/). It's made with focus
on very fast UI creation and minimizing boilerplate code.
